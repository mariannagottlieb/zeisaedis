Note: I made the pack, not the animations, I don't know how to animate. Just wanted to clarify because I think the people who made these animations deserve credit I went on a search for VRChat animations and this is what I found, found them from the unity asset store and also some links I found in youtube comments and reddit replies ( Mixamo (Mixamo.com) isn't included) It would help me if you guys also shared some free animations to me, even if you aren't interested in the pack since I still.

Mixamo was registered with Nom IQ Ltd (DBA Com Laude) on January At the end of last year mixamo was bought by Adobe and everything was transferred to them. At the moment, during what they are calling a preview phase all the animations and 3d characters are free. All the animations are compatible with mechanim and I think they are quite good quality(there is over 2000). If i remember rightly they were about  each so its about 000 worth of animations.

I have a character model (taken from https://www.mixamo.com/) with separate animations for walking and drawing a bow. However, the drawing bow animation points to the left of the character (ie. when the character is walking forwards, the bow will be drawn to aim to their left). I would like the bow to be drawn to aim in the direction that the player is facing. Is there a way that I can have the player hold their bow in front of them and aim forward? I can only think of rotating the animation.

im fairly new in blender and i now have a strange problem: i downloaded a rigged model from mixamo .com and imported it in blender, animated a bit with keyframes and wanted to test my hardware and some render settings, that worked fine. if i import the same model again, it doesn´t have a material, if i render it, it´s just white and in blender it´s pink when i choose to show the material. i must have changed some settings or something like that but i dont know what. smaller models Mixamo.com is tracked by us since April, 2011.

I have split this list into two sections. Part 1, this thread, focuses more on improvements to things that are already confirmed to be in the game. Part 2, which I'll post tomorrow, is about catering to playstyles other than banditry. Some of the suggestions below perhaps wouldn't fit in a game like AR1. That's fine, it's my understanding that AR2 is going to effectively reinvent the original game. I really think that they would add depth, without mixamo.com administrator info visit it.
